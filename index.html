					<p>My name is Fernando Pacheco. I was born and raised in San Francisco. I grew up in the Parkmerced district in SF which is adjacent to San Francisco State University. When I was a kid I always wanted to eventually go to that school since it was so close to home. Eventually I did turn my childhood dream into a reality and was accepted.
					Once I was enrolled I pursued a double major which focused on Criminal Justice and Latina/o Studies. The reason why I chose these as my majors was because I was planning on going to law school to focus on specifically imigration law. I wanted to become a Lawyer and make my family proud.
					<br></br>
					The plan at the time sounded solid to me and of course my parents. Later on I came to realize that a career in Law wasn't something I actually wanted. All I wanted out of that really was to make my parents proud and when it came down to it I didnt have the passion for it.
					After spending all that time in my undergrad focusing on degrees that I didn't even end up utilizing to go to Law School really struck me in the nerve. To be honest I was quite distraught and thought to myself that I really messed up big this time.
					<br></br>
					There was many different careers I looked into that would serve as options for the degrees I attained, but none of them I could see myself spending my life doing passionately as a career. One would think after all that to forget the idea of being passionate about a career and just get a job that makes the money.
					Then my girlfriend told me about this opportunity that UC Berkeley offers. She told me i've always been good with computers and that enrolling in the bootcamp course would be a perfect fit for me. All it took was the prework assigned to me to realize how much I loved to code. As cliche as it may sound I finally found out my passion for something. Which brings us here now writing a little bit about me off of a website that I learned how to create.</p>
